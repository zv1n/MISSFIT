        After you study each word pair, you will be asked to estimate how likely you will be to remember
        the word pair on a later recall test using a 0 to 100 scale where 0 = no confidence and
        100 = complete confidence that you will be able to recall the second word of the pair
        when shown the first word of each pair
        For example, you may be presented with a word pair such as "paperclip - yarn" and then, after
        5 seconds of study time asked, "On a scale of 0 to 100, how likely are you to remember the 
word pair on the upcoming recall test?" You will be asked to type ANY NUMBER between 0 and 100 
to indicate your confidence level. Later, on the recall task you will be shown the first word of
each pair and asked to type the word that was paired with it during the study phase.
<br>
<br>
There will be two trials each containing 48 word pairs. At the end of each trial
you will be given a recall test.
